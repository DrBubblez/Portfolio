## Description
This is my portfolio, which contains information about me, my projects, and my contact information. This project took a lot of time and effort to make, and I hope you enjoy it!
I plan to update this portfolio as I make more projects, so be sure to check back every once in a while! I also plan to add more features to this portfolio as a way to experiment with new and interesting technologies.
